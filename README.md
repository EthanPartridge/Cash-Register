# CashRegister
Simple cash register I built using C# and .net framework for CS 258 I believe.

Currently, it only tells the user how to give change back to the customer. For example, the program
will ask the user how much change is due. The user will type in $24.68. The program will then tell
the user to give the customer 1 twenty dollar bill, 4 one dollar bills, 2 quarters, 1 dime, 1 nickel,
and 3 pennies.

The .cs file is located in the "cash register" folder and is named "Program.cs".
